# RichHF-18K Dataset
RichHF-18K dataset contains rich human feedback labels we collected for our CVPR'24 paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10240, along with the original file name of the associated labeled images.

The labels to be released include subjective scores (e.g., aesthetics score), human-labeled heatmaps (e.g., artifact regions of distorted pixels) and misalignment tokens in the text prompts. The dataset contains 17,760 examples in Tensorflow Example format, consisting of 15,810 training examples, 995 development examples and 955 test examples. The dataset doesn't contain the original images, but only their filenames, which you can use to find the corresponding images from the original Pick-a-pic dataset.

The labels are annotated on generated images from Pick-a-pic v1: https://stability.ai/research/pick-a-pic

As the tfrecord files are stored with Git Large File Storage (LFS), before git clone the repo, you might need to install LFS: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage

The tfrecord file can be loaded by [tf.data.TFRecordDataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/TFRecordDataset) directly.

For **how to parse the tfrecord file** and match the misalignment labels to each token in the prompt, please see codes at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/richhf_18k
